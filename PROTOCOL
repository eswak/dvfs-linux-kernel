Systematic approach for performance evaluation
----------------------------------------------


1: State goals and define the system
------------------------------------
Comparison between a Signal processing and a deep learning approach for the detection and classification of real life sound.
Sound are recorded in different scenes and condition. Dataset provided by international and european organisation.
See Bird Audio Detection (BAD) challenge and DCASE challenge.


2: List services and outcomes
-----------------------------
- Advance the state of the art in sound detection and classification
- Many scientific usage: 
	- Help with very long records used for bio-scientific
	- Security (Detection car, broken glass, gun shot)
	- Monitoring wildlife activity
	- Monitoring city activity (Car, honk, bike, etc ...)


3: Select metrics
-----------------
Manly a comparison of two methods => How to compare them.
- Efficiency a.k.a accuracy of the solution.
	- For classification this implied the following metrics: Overall accuracy and recall (see definition)
- for deep learning: Training time, inference time
- for signal processing: Result time (how long it takes to have the result)


4: List parameters:
-------------------
- signal processing
	- Feature used
	- Sampling rate
	- quantification (number of bits)
	- sample lenght
	- number of channel

- Deep learning
	- Architecture used (CNN, resNet, denseNet)
	- Hardware
	- Backend (Library used: Tensorflow, torch, etc...)
	-

- Common:
	- Operating system
	- Driver version (for matarial acceleration)
	- Cuda version
	- Hardware (CPU, RAM, VRAM, SSD, HDD, etc..., PCIe version and line number ?)

	- sample lenght
	- number of sample (require for learning time and comparison time)
	- number of label ? (surpervised learning)
	- data augmentation technics


5: Select factors to study
--------------------------
What can change
	- Feature used
	- Data augmentation technics
	- Architecture (deep learning)
	- Library
	- 


6: Select evaluation technique
------------------------------
Experiment using real life sound sample provided by international or european entities (DCASE and BAD challenge for example)


7: Select workload
------------------
Set of script or program that will perform the experiment. It is necessary to do some pre and post production.


8: Design experiments
---------------------
Still in going


9: Analyze and interpret data
-----------------------------
- Signal processing
	- Analysis efficiency and comparison between the feature used
	- Comparison of usage or not of data augmentation

- Deep learning
	- Analysis of the effect of the architecture used
	- Usage or not of data augmentation

- Analysis of the effect of the feature extracted as a pre-treatment for deep learning
